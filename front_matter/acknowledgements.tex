\chapter{1}{Acknowledgements}{Acknowledgements}
\par I would like to thank all my committee members for their time and the numerous suggestions they provided throughout my research. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Maier for his guidance, constant encouragement and motivation to keep me going. I owe a great debt to Zachary Jones and Chris Barrick who facilitated my introduction into the project, and whose contributions laid the foundation for my work. I am thankful to my friends and family who kept me sane during these unprecedented times, where the whole world has come to a standstill due to COVID-19. I would like to thank everyone at the \textit{Institute for Artificial Intelligence} who presented me with an opportunity to be a part of this project. I would also like to thank Ms. Tino, whose assistance with the administrative tasks at the university made my life incredibly easy.
