This repository tracks the updates to my Thesis writing, summarizing my contributions to the _Solar Radiation Project_.

The `template` branch contains the template to the Thesis document, adhering to the UGA Graduate School guidelines, as described in https://grad.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/theses_and_dissertations.pdf

### Usage
The `thesis.cls` file describes the commands/outline, and a simple read through should suffice to get started.

To get a copy of the thesis template for your own work, switch to the `template` branch and fork it.

Star the repository if you find the template useful! ;)

### Contributing Guidelines
There are no specific guidelines for contributing. If you see something that could be improved, send a pull request! I am always happy to look at improvements.

If you think something should be done differently (or is just-plain-broken), please create an issue.
